# resource
The Resource is a collaboration between a team of artists and technologists who have come together to create a unique audio visual experience. Our goal is to push the boundaries of art and technology and to offer a new way of experiencing immersive art.

“The resource” is the result of a process that explores advanced collaborative workflows, AI for rapid sketching and concept projection, 3D modelling in VR,  real-time mapping of synchronised audio visuals, metaverse deployment.

The collaboration was initiated through an open call on Discord, a VoIP and instant messaging social platform.

Discord besides being used as the main communication and screen share platform,
is also used to run a shared Midjourney AI bot, this particular AI can use text and images to generate new images. As such it is a perfect tool to work simultaneously with several people and generate a shared vision.

Once a visual shared vision is achieved, a text can be sculpted with the help of a GPT-3 AI text generator, the word sculpting is used deliberately in this context, to achieve the final version of a text we(humans) use various subtractive and additive text editing methods.

Together these two elements, text and images, complement each other and form a cohesive and coherent foundation to engage the next step, collaborative 3D modelling in VR. The files shared in this repository are the results of this ongoing project.

  List of shared assets (this list will expand as we go along and develop more assets)
